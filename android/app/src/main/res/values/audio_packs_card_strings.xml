    <p><b><u>Audio Data Pack</u></b><br/>
      Exult can optionally make use of digital music and sound effects packages.  This android port is set up to make use of the all-in-one package.  To install it, browse to the <a href="https://exult.info/download.php">Exult Downloads page</a> and tap on &quot;Zipped all-in-one audio pack for manual installation&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you have downloaded the .zip file, tap the checkbox on the left.  This will open a file browser which you can use to select the archive you downloaded, and the installer will take care of extracting the required data files and installing them in the correct places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have successfully installed the audio pack, you are free to delete the .zip; it will no longer be needed or used by Exult after installation.
    </p>
    <p><b><u>MT32 ROMs</u></b><br/>
      For the MT32 emulation of the music you need the MT32 ROMs and the two ROMs need their filenames to be uppercase. Once you have the zipped ROMs on your android device, tap the checkbox on the left, select the zip in the file browser, and the files will be installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have successfully installed the ROMs, you are free to delete the .zip; it will no longer be needed or used by Exult after installation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that the MT32 ROM files are copyrighted and thus we are not offering a download. You need to dump the ROMs yourself to legally use these.
