<tr><td>
				<p>Jeff wrote on the Boards:<br><cite>
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite></p>
				<p>Ibrahim Holtzmann:<br><cite>
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".

<tr><td><strong><a id="is_exult_free">1.3. Is <em>Exult</em> free ?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <em>Exult</em> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <em>Exult</em> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <em>Exult</em>s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <em>Exult</em> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <em>Exult</em> please contact
					us via our
					<a href="https://github.com/exult/exult/discussions">forum</a>.<br>

<tr><td><strong><a id="exult_donation">1.4. Do you accept donations?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					No, the <em>Exult</em> team will not accept donations. For us there are greater legal matters
					involved, which none of us particularly want to explore. We do not want to risk the
					wrath of EA for directly profiting off <em>Exult</em>.<br>
				</p>
			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="origin_exult">1.5. Does Origin or EA support <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					First of all, Origin has been wiped from existence by EA a long time ago.
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin have claimed that
					the source code for Ultima VII (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <em>Exult</em> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin years ago but received
					neither positive or negative response on the <em>Exult</em> project. So far it seems
					that EA has decided to ignore <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated
					on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest
					(Programming Manager of Ultima VII)(hint:spell his name backwards).

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="other_ultimas">1.6. Will <em>Exult</em> support other Ultima games?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> supports only Ultima VII (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima VII in the
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering
					a game already.
				</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="pentagram">1.7. But isn't <em>Pentagram</em> some kind of <em>Exult</em> for U8?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Pentagram</em> is a pet project by some members of the <em>Exult</em> team (currently mostly
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong>
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <em>Exult</em>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br>
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</p>
				<p>
					After years this plan has come to fruit and <em>Pentagram</em> has been merged into
					<strong>ScummVM</strong>. Even support for the two games <strong>Crusader: No Remorse</strong>
					and <strong>Crusader: No Regret</strong>, which use the same engine, has been progressing
					in <strong>ScummVM</strong>'s code.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the official <em>Pentagram</em> homepage at <a href="http://pentagram.info/">http://pentagram.info/</a>
					you will find more information on this project of before the merge with
					<strong>ScummVM</strong>.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="multiplayer">1.8. Will there be a multiplayer <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					No.
				</p>
				<p>Jeff on the Forum:<br><cite>
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <em>Exult</em>, in large part, because
					nobody makes games like Ultima VII anymore. While I think a multiplayer game
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <b><i><span style="font-size: larger">lots</span></i></b>
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
				</cite></p>
				<p>
					Note however that <em>Exult</em> is open source. If you want a multiplayer Ultima VII no one
					holds you back to code it in.

<tr><td>
				<p>
					Bugs and not yet implemented features in <em>Exult</em> get fixed almost daily in the code.
					A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
				</p>
				<p>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated every
					night if commits landed in our repository on that day. There is information on how to
					build your own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows
					and macOS executables.<br>
					If there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code
					or the source failed to compile.

				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on
					any platform that SDL2 supports. Right now the source can be compiled
					in <strong>Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,</strong> and
					<strong>Windows (XP/Vista/7, 10, 11)</strong>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
<strong>iOS (iPhone and iPad)</strong><br>
					After initial porting by our member Lanica Dragon, Chaoji Li (aka Litchie)
					successfully ported <em>Exult</em> to iOS. On the iPad <em>Exult</em>  really shines
					and is very enjoyable. However Ultima VII's item management makes it much
					harder to use on the smaller iPhone screens.<br>
</li>

					<li>
<strong>Android, Java</strong><br>
					Jeff, Dr.Code, is started porting <em>Exult</em> to Android by rewriting it in Java.
					Unfortunately this port has been abandoned but its former progress can be viewed in its
					old	<a href="https://goo.gl/VJCNG">forum</a> thread.</li>

					<li>
<strong>Android, native</strong><br>
					KenC ported <em>Exult</em> directly to Android, without rewriting it in Java. After a long
					hiatus he continued his work on
					<a href="https://github.com/ceckak/exult/tree/android-port">Github</a>,
					before we merged it with <em>Exult</em> after our 1.8 release.</li>

				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> used to run on many more platforms but these are mostly devices and operating systems that have
					not been in use for ages now. Support for these has been removed from the Exult source to streamline
					our code. Or the 3rd party ports have been inactive for years.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
<strong>Windows 9X, 2k, XP</strong><br>
					Since we needed to go forward with our code we decided to no longer support the old Windows versions.</li>
					<li>
<strong>Zaurus</strong><br>
					Artaxerxes developed the port to Zaurus, a Linux/ARM based PDA.
					It is already fully playable (Artaxerxes played through SI). Pictures of the Zaurus
					running SI can be found at
					<a href="https://exult.info/images/screenshots/zaurus/">https://exult.info/images/screenshots/zaurus/</a>.</li>
					<li>
<strong>PocketPC</strong><br>
					Lanica Dragon successfully ported <em>Exult</em> to the PocketPC.</li>
					<li>
<strong>Amiga/MorphOS</strong><br>
					Ruediger Hanke ported <em>Exult</em> to MorphOS and AmigaOS. Unfortunately the port has
					been abandoned for quite some time now. But you can only find the archived homepage
					for this port at
					<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190600/http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190600/http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html</a>.
					Unfortunately the download is no longer available.</li>
					<li>
<strong>Dingoo</strong><br>
					<em>Exult</em> has been ported to Dingoo (see
					<a href="https://crankgaming.blogspot.com/2010/09/exult-v14svn6317-for-dingux-beta2.html">this Announcement</a>)
					by SiENcE.</li>
					<li>
<strong>Sony PSP</strong><br>
					Phantom Fighter ported <em>Exult</em> 1.2 to <a href="http://thefoodsucks.com/portfolio/exult-psp/">Sony PSP</a>
</li>
					<li>
<strong>Xbox 360</strong><br>
					And Cancerous1 is in the progress of porting <em>Exult</em> to
					<a href="https://code.google.com/p/exultx-nosdlmixer/">Xbox 360</a>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					A long time ago <em>Exult</em> used to compile on <strong>MacOS 8.5</strong> (or higher),
					<strong>Solaris</strong> and <strong>BeOS</strong>.

			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="any_port">1.15. Will there be a port of <em>Exult</em> for &lt;insert platform here&gt;?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					That depends on a great many things. For one, it requires a developer that (1) has the
					necessary free time, (2) the necessary knowledge about programming for the platform in
					question, (3) the necessary motivation to do the port and (4) access to the platform in
					question. Any of the <em>Exult</em> developers may lack one or more of the items above, but it
					will probably the fourth (and, by consequence, the third) item. This is likely fatal
					for the port: programming using an emulator (if one is even available) may result in a
					port that works on the emulator but not on the original (unless the emulator is that
					good), and programming without any access at all to the platform in question is a
					pointless and frustrating exercise in futility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, some platforms might require BG and/or SI to come bundled with <em>Exult</em>; that alone
					would disqualify any official builds for legal reasons.

					The reported problems were that conversation threads didn't seem to skip to the
					next line in the proper places and therefore were unreadable in some cases.<br>
					SI was published in English and Spanish (to our surprise)
					but we seem to have fixed the main problem with the Spanish version.

					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all

					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,

				<p>
					In <em>Exult</em> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than

					formation has effects on other game internals. Changing it to be more like the
					original may force us to replay the whole game to make sure we didn't introduce
					new bugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some time ago Jeff added an optional formation that behaves way more like in the
					original game and it has become the default formation now.<br>
					This can be changed in the <a href="ReadMe.html#exult_config">exult.cfg</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Jeff:<br><cite>
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to

					Ultima VII looked really stupid. Eventually, someone may add the original type of walking
					to <em>Exult</em>, probably as an option.

				<p>
					This is <strong>not</strong> normal behavior for <em>Exult</em>. Normally when you restart

				<p>
					<b><i><span style="font-size: larger">Please do not play further</span></i></b> at this point. You should restore to an earlier

<tr><td><strong><a id="improvements">3.13.
				What are the improvements in <em>Exult</em> over the original Ultima VII?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<ul>
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the
					'<span class="highlight">k</span>' key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>
				<li>A new worked over Game Options menu. This menu is explained in detail in the
					<a href="docs.html">Documentation</a> and many of the following
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open
					this Game Options Menu by pressing '<span class="highlight">Esc</span>' in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the
					Gameplay Options.<br>
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new save game box. This allows you much more save games than
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of save game
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game
					box is opened either via the game menu or the '<span class="highlight">s</span>' key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Double-clicking on the face opens
					the inventory and double-clicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheel mouse support. If you have a wheel mouse some features are auto-enabled
					in <em>Exult</em>.<br>
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right.
					Holding down '<span class="highlight">Alt</span>' while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br>
					The save game menu scrolls one line, while pressing '<span class="highlight">Alt</span>' it scrolls
					pages.<br>
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing
					'<span class="highlight">Alt</span>'  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in full screen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed save games. <em>Exult</em> compresses save games by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the save game name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				<li>A notebook for making notes and the possibility to automatically add notes.</li>
				<li>Shortcut bar on top of the screen with many useful shortcuts. This is especially
					useful for touch devices without a physical keyboard (.e.g. iOS devices).</li>
				<li>The Serpent Isle extended intro. This was slimmed down in the original to save
					floppy disk space but we restored it from material posted online by the artist
					Denis Loubet.</li>

					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.<br>
					That means:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. For this to change we'd
					need a volunteer to recreate a lot of paperdoll art for a smaller paperdoll.

						Serpents Isle.<br>
						To enable the old save game menu you have to assign '<span class="highlight">s</span>' to old_file_gump
						(the line in your custom key bindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)</li>
					<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
					<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
					<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Display
						options.</li>
					<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and
						disable scalers.</li>
					<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot
						be altered. Sorry!</li>

						those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav
						(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename in the
						save game dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game
						may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to
						report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit
						as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).</li>

					<em>Exult</em> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima VII. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original
					worked.<br>
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount
					of time and effort to fix.<br>
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done
					differently sits down and codes it.<br>
					The following are such 'features' of <em>Exult</em>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient
						creatures of Britannia do. You should rarely encounter this anymore
						since there are better intelligence checks, but it can still happen.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this was disputed almost every four weeks.
						Finally it works like the original and the Avatar uses two frames and the
						companions use three frames.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <em>Exult</em>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by Ultima VII's original data
						files but the original didn't. Users who prefer the original (broken) are able
						to choose so in the Game menu.</li>
					<li>Some sound effects (sfx) are missing. While we still haven't implemented some sfx,
						most are playing and we have improved upon the original by allowing more sound
						effects to play at the same time and also balance the effect when it is a continuous
						one, meaning its volume is affected how near you are the sfx playing object and also
						differs between left and right. However we found the fire effects to be terrible in
						quality and have disabled these. So no crackling fire for the flaming sword,
						campfires, etc.</li>

<tr><td><strong><a id="why_gameplayfaq">5.1. Why is there a gameplay FAQ?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					Although you can find many useful gameplay FAQs on the internet we do get asked
					some questions quite frequently as people think these are bugs with <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the times the problem is that people don't play the game regularly but depend
					overly on walkthroughs and don't read what NPCs in the game tell you to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Note that this section contains text that may spoil your game.
					Caution is advised.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We added a mark to the question (BG/FoV/SI/SS) to show which Ultima VII game is
					affected by this. See <a href="ReadMe.html#terms">ReadMe</a> to learn which game
					these marks point to.
				</p>
			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="who_speaks">5.2. Why don't all NPCs have audible speech (BG+SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					The documentation and installation files of the original may be a bit misleading.
					There are only a few NPCs in the games that have audible speech. In BG only the
					Guardian can be heard during the game.<br>
					Apart from the Intro you can only hear the Guardian and the Great Earth Serpent
					in SI.
				</p>
			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="reagents_differ">5.3. Why do spells require different reagents than the manual lists (BG+SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					The manuals of both BG and SI listed different requirements for two spells than what
					was actually required in the original game and <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>BG Restoration<br>
						The original game and <em>Exult</em> use garlic, ginseng, mandrake root, spider silk.<br>
						Manual lists garlic, ginseng, mandrake root, sulfurous ash.</li>
					<li>SI Imbalance<br>
						The original game and <em>Exult</em> use bloodspawn, nightshade, serpent scale, sulfurous ash,
						worm heart,<br>
						while the Manual lists nightshade, serpent scale, sulfurous ash, worm heart.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Unfortunately very old <em>Exult</em> versions were also wrong in more spell requirements and
					reagent costs. This has since been corrected.
				</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="sextant_roof">5.4. Why can't I see my location on the map (BG+SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					To see your location marked on the map with a yellow cross you need to have sextant
					in your inventory. And you need to be in the open. Since you can't use a sextant
					under a roof, in a cave or in a dungeon you will not see your position marked there.
				</p>
			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="how_move_ships">5.5. So why can't I sail a ship in BG?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					To sail a ship in BG you naturally need to have the deed to this ship in your party.
					Then double-click on the sail of the ship and your party moves aboard it and sits down.
					Once they are all seated, double-click the gangplank to close it. Now double-click on
					the sail once more to have it unfold. You should be able to move the ship then.

<tr><td><strong><a id="virtue_stones">5.6. Why can't I cast mark/recall on the Virtue Runes (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					You never could do this in the original as well. You have to use the
					<strong>Virtue Stones</strong> that you find in the same building as the runes.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="skarabrae_sacrifice">5.7. Why can't I get the sacrifice in Skara Brae to work (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					"I'm trying to get Forsythe in Skara Brae to sacrifice himself to destroy the well of
					souls. But I can't seem to get Rowenna or Trent to talk to me about sacrifice."<br>
					The solution to this is that Rowenna and Trent are standing too far apart. When you
					reunited the pair you initiated the conversation with Trent from too far away
					(this happens when you run at a higher resolution than the original one).<br>
					Now you can either reload a game from before you reunited them or you have to hackmove
					Rowenna closer to Trent. After that the two will talk to you about sacrifice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stuart Hillman told us of another way around this bug: Stand next to Trent when talking to Rowenna
					and next to her when talking to Trent.
				</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="skarabrae_forsythe">5.8. Why can't I talk to the mayor of Skara Brae (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					You might be talking to "The Other Forsythe"(TM). There's a ghost in the Skara Brae
					town hall that looks like Forsythe, but isn't.<br>
					This was fixed in more recent versions of <em>Exult</em> but with games started with earlier
					versions this bug is still present. You need to start a new game of <em>Exult</em> to fix
					this. But this bug poses no problem, so if you don't want to start a new game,
					just ignore that clone and search for the real Forsythe.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="skarabrae_mute">5.9. Why can't I talk to anyone in Skara Brae (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					To talk to the ghosts in Skara Brae you need to cast Seance. But this spell has a time
					limit so you might need to cast it again when the ghosts ignore you.

<tr><td><strong><a id="tetrahedron">5.10. Multiple problems with the tetrahedron generator and prism (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					Some of our users have problems entering the generator and finding the prism afterwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					To enter the tetrahedron generator you have to wear the ethereal ring (enchanted by Penumbra).
					It is important to <strong>wear</strong> the ring on a finger and not just hold it like a weapon.
				</p>
				<p>
					After you defeated the enemy you have to double click the prism to destroy the generator.
					You will then find the black prism (without the yellow outline) to your feet. Look
					closely and take it with you.

<tr><td><strong><a id="alagnar_dead">5.11. Why is Alagnar not dead (BG)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					At a certain point in the game Alagnar is supposed to be murdered. Unfortunately
					there is a bug in the original game data, that lets him walk around alive in his
					own murder scene. To avoid this bug you have to enter his house through the south door.

<tr><td><strong><a id="demon_gem">5.12. Where did my gem of the Demon vanish to (FoV)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					For forging the black sword you need to bind the demon to the gem you got from
					that invincible dragon you met in the test of courage. Some people mistake that
					little dark-blue gem with the glowing gem you received from Lord British.<br>
					If you use the glowing gem on the isle of fire it just vanishes with a shattering
					sound.

<tr><td><strong><a id="stone_of_castambre">5.13. Attacking the Stone of Castambre doesn't work (FoV)</a></strong></td></tr>

				<p>
					You need to <b><i><span style="font-size: larger">use</span></i></b> (double-click) the pick while it's in your hands

<tr><td><strong><a id="pikeman_disappears">5.14. Where is the pikeman that lets you train in Monitor (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					The pikeman that lets you enter the list field in Monitor sometimes disappears due
					to a bug in the game (even the original).<br>
					This bug occurs when you enter the banquet scene of Monitor. To avoid this bug, we
					recommend, that you approach the banquet hall from the right and/or double-click the
					entrance door to the hall when the party is standing very close to it.

					When you are at the Sleeping Bull, do <b><i><span style="font-size: larger">NOT</span></i></b> close the gangplank to Captain Hawk's ship.
					After you've got him out of Jail and you are ready for him to take you to Moonshade, he will
					not be able to do so when the gangplank is closed. If you have accidentally done that you will
					have to resort to cheating (enable hackmover) for fixing that.

<tr><td><strong><a id="fedabiblio_quest">5.16. How do I get the Mandrake Roots for Fedabiblio (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					Fedabiblio in Moonshade sends you on a quest to find fresh Mandrake Roots. You get
					to Monk Island but can't find the any fresh roots.<br>
					The problem is that fresh roots only appear depending on the tide. One of the nameless
					monks of the island tells you to ask him when the tide is right. Keep coming back to him
					and when he tells you the tide is right walk to the northern shore of the island to find
					fresh roots.

<tr><td>
				<p>
					Pothos won't take the moss if he hasn't sent you to fetch it for him. If you want
					him to tell you about the mad mage and how to get to him you first have to talk with
					Bucia (also in Moonshade) about Pothos. Then you can talk to Pothos about it and he will
					sent you off to fetch him fresh blood moss. Read what he says because it is important to
					get <strong>fresh</strong> blood moss.

<tr><td><strong><a id="great_hierophant">5.18. Why can't I summon the Great Hierophant (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					If you follow some walkthrough you might find that your summoning of the
					Great Hierophant doesn't work. This is a problem with the walkthrough. You
					need to have a personal item of the Great Hierophant in your inventory, namely
					the Serpent Staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					If possible don't just play following the walkthrough, but go out and explore
					Serpent Isle. It's hard to imagine someone could miss the cave to the east of
					Monitor.

<tr><td><strong><a id="xenka_sacrifice">5.19. Why won't Xenka speak about sacrifice (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					For Xenka to speak about sacrifice some parts of the game need to have been played
					correctly. The sacrifice conversation option will only turn up if:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>you have returned the amulet to the Gwani <strong>AND</strong>
</li>
					<li>you have spoken with the Chaos Hierophant <strong>AND</strong>
</li>
					<li>you have picked up the Serpent Staff from its proper location
					(see <a href="#serpent_staff">5.23.</a>) <strong>AND</strong>

					<li>you have not yet healed the Chaos Serpent</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="si_npc_gone">5.20. Where did XY disappear to (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					SI is very plot driven, so to stop people from breaking the plot, certain NPCs
					stay in a unaccessible spot on the map until you meet them by following the plot,
					or disappear from the map until they are needed again. If you cheat by
					teleporting to them before the scripted meeting you are bound to break the plot
					and most likely forced to reload an earlier savegame or start the whole game again.<br>
					So please take care when teleporting around the map.

<tr><td><strong><a id="karnax_gone">5.21. Why can't I find Karnax, Xenka or the other monks (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					See the above question. You have to use the Dark Path to make the monks appear
					on Monk Island. If you just use the teleport cheat they won't show up.
				</p>
				<p>
					The same applies to Xenka. Even though Xenka returns to Monk Island while you
					are there, next time you return to the island you will need to go through the
					Dark Path. Otherwise she will not be found there.

<tr><td><strong><a id="cure_companions">5.22. Why can't I cure my friends of their madness (SI)?</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					After defeating the Banes in the White Dragon Castle, your friends are dead and
					need to be revived and subsequently cured of their madness. Instead of reviving
					them through the hourglass, take the bodies to Monk Island monastery. Ask Karnax
					to revive them and then cure them with the respective waters. If you revive and
					cure them elsewhere, you will not be able to cure the last of them because you
					need to be on Monk Island.

<tr><td><strong><a id="serpent_staff">5.23. An important note about the Serpent Staff (SI)</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					The Serpent Staff in SI is a very important item. It doesn't seem like it but
					it is crucial to some major plot elements that you have the staff in your
					possession.<br>
					Unfortunately the game also demands that you get the staff properly. For that I
					recommend to get it without cheating and to stand right next to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just picking it up and not transferring it to the inventory at once, but instead
					putting it on the ground again could break later plot. Willem coded a workaround
					in <em>Exult</em> so the problem might disappear.

<tr><td><strong><a id="pillars_fort">5.24. How to break the plot by double clicking some pillars (SI-SS)</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					In the dining hall of the fort in the add-on Silver Seed you can double click the
					pillars. This teleports you to the test in the gargoyle city. If you haven't done
					this test yet this breaks that plot later on and if you already have it is still a
					nuisance. So better don't do it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously a slight oversight of the add-on designers. Could be fixed by changing the
					usecode and the map slightly.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong><a id="altar_discipline">5.25. Left or right on the Altar of Discipline (SI)</a></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>
				<p>
					In the Temple of Discipline you need to place a quartz and obsidian symbol
					(Y-shape) onto the altar to disable the trap and to call a bridge into being.<br>
					The book "The Symbol of Discipline" you find in the upper floor states:
				</p>
				<p>The Symbol of Discipline by Sharless:<br><cite>
					The altar before the serpent statue doth have upon it two slots ...
					bolts of lightning fire from the altar unless the quartz symbol is placed
					in the slot on the left side. A bridge ... is called into being if the obsidian
					symbol is placed in the right slot...
				</cite></p>
				<p>
					This is highly confusing as the player looks at the screen and associates west
					in the game with left and east with right. Whoever wrote this originally must
					have imagined the Avatar standing to the north of the altar and facing the temple
					entrance.<br>
					So you need to place the quartz symbol onto the east depression of the altar and
					the obsidian symbol onto the west depression.

				<p>
					The original and <em>Exult</em> determine the ability to open doors by the intelligence
