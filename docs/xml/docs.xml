			<header>What is <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Ultima VII, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project that created
					an Ultima VII game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is written in C++ and runs on, at least, Linux, macOS and Windows
					using the SDL2 library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports all of &quot;Ultima VII: The Black Gate&quot;
					and &quot;Ultima VII - Part 2: The Serpent Isle&quot;, allowing you to
					finish both games. This is only possible due to the work done
					by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima VII data files,
					especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Schonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima VII (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					&quot;Ultima VII: The Black Gate&quot; and/or
					&quot;Ultima VII - Part 2: The Serpent Isle&quot; and optionally
					the add-ons (not required to run) in order to use <Exult/>,
					and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.

		<sub name="terms">
			<header>Terms we use in regard to Exult and Ultima VII</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					We are using many terms in this documentation, the FAQ and other documentation
					files that people may have difficulties to understand. Here we will try to give
					some explanations.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>BG</strong>, <strong>SI</strong>, <strong>FoV</strong>
					or <strong>SS</strong>:<br/>
						we refer to &quot;Ultima VII: The Black Gate&quot; as BG and to
						&quot;Ultima VII - Part 2: The Serpent Isle&quot;
						as SI. The add-ons &quot;Forge of Virtue&quot; and &quot;Silver Seed&quot; are
						called FoV and SS.</li>
					<li><strong>eggs</strong>:<br/>
						these are trip-wires that can cause monsters to spawn, execute scripts, play
						music, change weather, trigger traps or teleport when you get near them.</li>
					<li><strong>flex files</strong>:<br/>
						also known as flexes, these are used by the original to store the data files.
						Also when you choose to not use compressed save games (see save_compression_level in
						<ref target="exult_config"/>) our savegames are also 'flexed'.</li>
					<li><strong>gumps</strong>:<br/>
						the windows used in the game interface for containers, characters, menus, etc..</li>
					<li><strong>paperdoll</strong>:<br/>
						when pressing <key>i</key> you get the inventory display. It's the picture of your
						characters body (or the bodies of your party members) onto which you can drag all
						kinds of equipment. The way this is displayed in SI is commonly called
						paperdoll. We integrated this for BG as well.
						(see <extref doc="faq" target="improvements"/>).</li>
					<li><strong>shapes</strong>:<br/>
						shape files are the format used for storage of all graphics elements (from UI buttons
						to terrain features) of the games <Exult/> supports. Shapes may contain one or more
						frames (a frame is a single image).</li>
					<li><strong>snapshot</strong>:<br/>
						see <extref doc="faq" target="whatis_snapshot"/>.<br/>
						Please note that our documentation usually refers to the latest snapshot.</li>
					<li><strong>usecode</strong>:<br/>
						that's the scripting language that drives all of Ultima VII (conversations, objects...).</li>
					<li><strong>Exult data folder</strong>:<br/>
						that's the folder where <Exult/> stores its data files (exult.flx, exult_bg.flx and
						exult_si.flx).</li>
					<li><strong>gamename</strong><br/>
						name of games that are set in exult.cfg's &lt;game&gt;, <Exult/> knows by default
						the gamenames <em>blackgate</em>, <em>forgeofvirtue</em>, <em>serpentisle</em>,
						<em>silverseed</em> and <em>serpentbeta</em>.</li>

		<sub name="installation">
			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>First you need to get Ultima VII. Either you own it already, or
						you buy it somewhere.</li>
					<li>You need an installed version of Ultima VII to run <Exult/> with.
						At <section_ref target="Installing the original Ultima VII games for use with Exult"/>
						we have a guide on how to install the original games or use the version offered by GOG.com.</li>
					<li>Download <Exult/> from our
						<extref target="https://exult.info/download.html">download page</extref>
						and install it. The Windows version comes with an installer that asks for the
						location of both BG and SI. If you entered the correct location or you are using the default
						games locations on Linux systems and macOS the next two steps are not necessary.</li>
					<li>Now run <strong>exult</strong> (<strong>exult.exe</strong> on Windows)
						and quit it immediately.</li>
					<li>Edit the configuration file with a text editor (e.g. on Windows use Notepad)
						and enter the correct paths for the game folders - see <ref target="exult_config"/>
						for details</li>
					<li>Run <strong>exult</strong> and enjoy the game :-)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					<strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="exult_config_location">
			<header>Location of exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Most of the options in <Exult/> can be changed from the <strong>Setup</strong>
					menu when you run <Exult/> or via the Game Options menu. <Exult/> stores these
					changes in a configuration file. Except for changing paths to the games you
					shouldn't need to edit the file. Very few options need manual editing.<br/>
					However if you need to edit the configuration file, it is extensively explained
					in <section_ref target="The exult.cfg file"/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					The location of the file varies depending on the Operating System and in the
					case of Windows OS it also depends on the version of Windows.
				</para>
					<ul>
						<li>On Linux systems you can expect to find it in <kbd>$HOME/.exult.cfg</kbd>, or
						  in <kbd>$HOME/.var/apps/info.exult.exult/config/exult.cfg</kbd> if using the
						  <extref target="https://flathub.org/apps/info.exult.exult">Flatpak package</extref></li>
						<li>macOS saves it to <kbd>~/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg</kbd></li>
						<li>Windows (7, 8, 10, 11) save exult.cfg to <kbd>LOCAL_APPDATA\Exult</kbd>,
							but on these this translates to <kbd>C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Exult</kbd></li>
						<li>On all supported Windows versions you can quickly access this folder by executing<br/>
							<kbd>shell:Local AppData\Exult</kbd><br/>
							in the 'Quick Access' of Explorer.</li>

		<sub name="default_macos">
			<header>Default game folders on macOS</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					On macOS <Exult/> uses a couple of different folders to follow Apple's guidelines:
				</para>
				<para>
					Note that on macOS <Exult/> looks in a default folder (<kbd>/Library/Application Support/Exult/data</kbd>)
					for <Exult/>'s data and the files of the games. On purpose this folder is not in the User-only
					space, so other users on the same mac can play the games and use the Exult.app.<br/>
					<strong>But</strong> you will need to follow our gamename standard when you name the game
					folders, see <ref1 target="terms"/>, otherwise <Exult/> will not find them there.<br/>
					Another specialty on macOS is that the Exult.app comes bundled with the <Exult/> data, so
					<Exult/> will first use the data in the Exult.app and then use the data in the default folder
					or the location written down in exult.cfg's &lt;data_path&gt;.<br/>
					This means that you can copy the sfx files and the digital music folder into the app bundle
					(<kbd>Exult.app/Contents/Resources/data</kbd>) and <Exult/> will automatically use these.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example: User named <strong>FooBar</strong> on <strong>macOS 14</strong>. BG is installed to
					<kbd>/Library/Application Support/Exult/blackgate</kbd> and SI is installed to
					<kbd>/Library/Application Support/Exult/serpentisle</kbd>.<br/>
					The app Exult.app is saved to <kbd>/Applications</kbd>. When you run <Exult/> it will automatically
					recognize that BG and SI are installed. You do not need to edit exult.cfg, which is saved
					to <kbd>/Users/FooBar/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg</kbd>.<br/>
					When you save a game in BG the savegame will be saved to
					<kbd>/Users/FooBar/Library/Application Support/exult/blackgate/</kbd>,
					for SI to <kbd>Users/FooBar/Library/Application Support/exult/serpentisle/</kbd>.<br/>
					If you install for example the keyring mod, you copy the contents of the Keyring.zip to
					<kbd>/Library/Application Support/Exult/blackgate/mods</kbd>. When you save a game with the
					Keyring mod, this savegame will be found in
					<kbd>/Users/FooBar/Library/Application Support/exult/blackgate/mods/keyring/</kbd>.
				</para>
				<para>
					Please be aware of the difference between <kbd>/Library/...</kbd> and <kbd>~/Library/...</kbd>.<br/>
					In the root of your macOS system hard drive is the folder <kbd>/Library</kbd>. The folder
					<kbd>~/Library</kbd> is a sub folder of your home folder. If your username is foobar then the folder
					<kbd>~/Library</kbd> is located at <kbd>/Users/foobar/Library</kbd> on your hard drive.<br/>
					On macOS the folder <kbd>~/Library</kbd> is hidden by default. To access it open Finder,
					click on the menu item 'Go' while pressing <key>Option/Alt</key> and 'Library' will be an option
					to click on.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you followed all the instructions and <Exult/> still won't recognize the games, you can try
					deleting exult.cfg in <kbd>~/Library/Preferences</kbd> and then start <Exult/> to generate
					a new cfg file.
				</para>
				<para>
					At <ref1 target="path_config_osx"/> you can see an exult.cfg example with the macOS defaults.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="default_nix">
			<header>Default game folders on Linux</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					As on macOS, <Exult/> uses a default path on Linux systems for its data folder and the game files.
					Unless you configure custom paths in <kbd>exult.cfg</kbd>, <Exult/> will automatically look for
					the game data files in <kbd>/usr/local/share/exult</kbd>, or in the case of the the
					<extref target="https://flathub.org/apps/info.exult.exult">Flatpak package</extref>, in
					<kbd>$HOME/.var/app/info.exult.exult/data/</kbd>.<br/>
					<strong>But</strong> you will need to follow our gamename standard when you name the game
					folders, see <ref1 target="terms"/>, otherwise <Exult/> will not find them there.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example: User named <strong>FooBar</strong> on <strong>Ubuntu</strong>. BG is installed to
					<kbd>/usr/local/share/exult/blackgate</kbd> and SI is installed to
					<kbd>/usr/local/share/exult/serpentisle</kbd>.
					When you run <Exult/> it will automatically recognize that BG and SI are installed. You do not
					need to edit exult.cfg, which is saved to <kbd>$HOME/.exult.cfg</kbd>.<br/>
					When you save a game in BG the savegame will be saved to <kbd>$HOME/.exult/blackgate/</kbd>,
					for SI to <kbd>$HOME/.exult/serpentisle/</kbd>.<br/>
					If you install for example the keyring mod, you copy the contents of the Keyring.zip to
					<kbd>/usr/local/share/Exult/blackgate/mods</kbd>. When you save a game with the Keyring mod,
					this savegame will be found in <kbd>$HOME/.exult/blackgate/mods/keyring/</kbd>.
				</para>
				<para>
					At <ref1 target="path_config_nix"/> you can see an exult.cfg example with the Linux defaults.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="command_line">
			<header>Command line options</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> offers some command line options:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><key>-h</key> or <key>--help</key><br/>
						Shows all the command line parameters in stderr (stderr.txt on Windows systems).</li>
					<li><key>-v</key> or <key>--version</key><br/>
						Shows version information in stderr.</li>
					<li><key>-c configfile</key><br/>
						Specify alternate config file (relative or absolute paths work).</li>
					<li><key>-p</key><br/>
						Portable option for Windows only. <Exult/> will read cfg file from the folder it got
						installed to (or make one) and will assume the games to be in the gamename subfolders
						(see <ref target="terms"/>).<br/>
						For example if <Exult/> got installed to <kbd>E:\Exult</kbd>, a BG game will be expected
						to be in <kbd>E:\Exult\blackgate</kbd>. Savegames will also be saved in these folders.<br/>
						Be careful that you have actually writing permissions in the <Exult/> folder or
						this will fail.</li>
					<li><key>--bg</key><br/>
						Starts the game with the Black Gate menu (prefers original game).</li>
					<li><key>--fov</key><br/>
						Starts the game with the menu of the Black Gate with Forge of Virtue expansion.
						Only useful if you have FoV added as described at <ref target="advanced_config"/>,
						otherwise it will just work like the command <key>--bg</key>.</li>
					<li><key>--si</key><br/>
						Starts the game with the Serpent Isle menu (prefers original game).</li>
					<li><key>--ss</key><br/>
						Starts the game with the menu of the Serpent Isle with Silver Seed expansion.
						Only useful if you have SS added as described at <ref target="advanced_config"/>,
						otherwise it will just work like the command <key>--si</key>.</li>
					<li><key>--sib</key><br/>
						Starts the game with the menu of the Serpent Isle beta version.</li>
					<li><key>--nomenu</key><br/>
						Skips game menu.</li>
					<li><key>--game gamename</key><br/>
						Loads a game specified in exult.cfg when there are other games made
						with <Studio/>.</li>
					<li><key>--mod modname</key><br/>
						Must be used together with <key>--bg</key>, <key>--si</key>, <key>--fov</key>,
						<key>--ss</key>, <key>--sib</key> or <key>--game gamename</key>; runs the specified
						game using the mod with title equal to <key>modname</key>. <key>modname</key> is the
						name of the mod cfg file (e.g. keyring.cfg means 'modname' is 'keyring'.</li>
					<li><key>--buildmap x</key><br/>
						x = 0 shows all roofs, x = 2 pops them all.<br/>
						Makes 144 2048x2048 pixels screenshots of the game map which you will need to piece
						together. The screenshots are numbered according to the
						<extref doc="studio" target="ifix_iregs">ifix/ireg map</extref>.<br/>
						By default the screenshots are PNG files. In the unlikely case that <Exult/> was compiled
						without libpng support, buildmap will output PCX files.<br/>
						<Exult/> is required to be run in windowed mode and you get the best map if you
						started a new game before you build the map.<br/>
						You need to specify a game, either by <key>--bg</key> (or <key>--si</key>,
						<key>--fov</key>, <key>--ss</key>, <key>--sib</key>) or with the
						<key>--game</key>/<key>--mod</key> option.</li>
					<li><key>--mapnum</key><br/>
						This must be used with <key>--buildmap</key> to select a map in multimap games or mods.</li>
					<li><key>--nocrc</key><br/>
						<Exult/> doesn't start when the crc of the
						exult*.flx files in the data folder isn't the same it got compiled with.
						This parameter lets the game start nevertheless. Don't try this if you
						don't know what you are doing as it is likely to crash <Exult/>.</li>
					<li><key>--verify-files</key><br/>
						Verifies that the files in static dir are not corrupt.<br/>
						Only valid if used together with <key>--bg</key>, <key>--si</key>, <key>--fov</key>,
						<key>--ss</key>, <key>--sib</key> or <key>--game gamename</key>; you cannot specify a mod with this flag.</li>
					<li><key>--edit</key><br/>
						Start in map-edit mode. This will also load <Studio/> when the game is started.</li>
					<li><key>--write-xml</key><br/>
						Write <kbd>patch/exultgame.xml</kbd>. Only useful for game editing.</li>
					<li><key>--reset-video</key><br/>
						resets <Exult/>'s video settings to the default values. Very helpful when <Exult/>
						isn't playable anymore because of wrong settings.</li>

		<sub name="error_log">
			<header>Error Log</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Windows:</strong><br/>
						<Exult/> generates the files <kbd>stdout.txt</kbd> and <kbd>stderr.txt</kbd>.
						These may give you some idea of what is going on
						under the hood. When <Exult/> suddenly quits, sometimes
						these files can help.<br/>
						You can find these files in the folder where exult.cfg is
						located (see <ref target="exult_config_location"/>)</li>
					<li><strong>Linux/UNIX:</strong><br/>
						the above mentioned logs are shown in the console from which <Exult/>
						is started.<br/>
						<kbd>./exult &gt;&amp;$HOME/exult_log.txt</kbd><br/>
						will send both stderr and stdout to the file named <kbd>exult_log.txt</kbd>
						in your <kbd>$HOME</kbd> folder.</li>
					<li><strong>macOS:</strong><br/>
						Similar to Linux, you need to start <Exult/> from the Terminal.app to see the
						logs or redirect them to a text file. Use <br/>
						<kbd>/Applications/Exult.app/Contents/MacOS/exult &gt;&amp;$HOME/exult_log.txt</kbd><br/>

						As many people think that the U7 combat engine is far too easy, too hard or
						just can't stand the real-time-combat we put in some options to make combat more
						interesting:</li>
					<li><strong>Combat Show Hits</strong><br/>
						With this enabled you can see the hit points of NPCs in brackets after their name when
						you left-click on them.</li>
					<li><strong>Combat paused with Space</strong><br/>
						choose between Original and SpacePauses. SpacePauses gives you a little more control of
						combat. When you hit space the game pauses and you can direct a party member by
						right-clicking, then clicking on a target to attack. Or change weapons, choose a
						favorite spell.</li>
					<li><strong>Combat Charmed difficulty</strong><br/>
						choose between Normal and Hard. With Normal the Avatar can't be charmed. The original game allowed
						him to be charmed though that only highlighted him as charmed and the charmed status icon showed
						but you could control him as usual.<br/>
						Hard will neither allow the player to control charmed party members, including the Avatar, nor
						access the inventory of a charmed party member. But you can still manipulate objects that are not
						in the charmed party members possessions even if the Avatar is the one who is charmed. Charmed
						party members will continue to attack, even if the player ends combat.</li>
					<li><strong>Combat Difficulty</strong><br/>
						Ranges from Easiest (-3) to Hardest (3). It affects the chance of a hit, and
						the HP that is lost if a hit occurs.</li>
					<li><strong>Cheats</strong><br/>
						Enables or disables all the cheats that we implemented in <Exult/>.
						See <ref1 target="exult_cheats"/> what those cheats are.</li>

					There are three general ways that music is played in <Exult/>. One is using MIDI, which
					plays the music through any MIDI device, software synthesizers (TiMidity,FluidSynth) or
					even MIDI device emulators like Munt MT-32 Emulator (or <Exult/>'s built-in MT32Emu).
					Another way is Digital Music encoded into OGG (similar to MP3) which was recorded
					directly from a Roland MT-32.
					The third option is FMOpl which emulates Opl2/Adlib.<br/>
					The MIDI files are converted on-the-fly from the original Ultima VII MT-32 files to
					General MIDI format so that they will be playable on modern General MIDI and
					General MIDI/GS supporting sound cards.
				</para>
				<para>
					The Music driver options can be changed in the in-game menu that you open by hitting
					<key>ESC</key>.<br/>
					There you can enable Digital Music and change the MIDI driver, through which you can

					The MIDI driver can be changed to:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Default</strong><br/>
						This setting utilizes the FMOpl driver.</li>
					<li><strong>FMOPL</strong><br/>
						This is a Software FM Synthesizer (also known as a emulated Opl2/Adlib).</li>
					<li><strong>TiMidity</strong><br/>
						is a software synthesizer that can play MIDI files without a hardware synthesizer.
						You can install TiMidity on all major Operating systems. You need to place tmidity.cfg
						into the same folder where the <Exult/> executable is installed to, otherwise TiMidity
						will not work. On linux systems it needs to be in ~/.exult.</li>
					<li><strong>FluidSynth</strong><br/>
						is another software synthesizer, which uses SoundFont 2 technology without need for a
						SoundFont-compatible sound card. It is available for many Operating Systems and in contrast
						to TiMidity still actively developed.<br/>
						To use FluidSynth you just need to copy a Soundfont file into the data and select it in the 
						<ref1 target="advanced_midi_gump"/>.<br/>
						<Exult/> supports FluidSynth's SoundFont stack. SoundFonts can be selected in the 
						<ref1 target="advanced_midi_gump"/>.<br/>
						<extref target="https://www.fluidsynth.org/api/LoadingSoundfonts.html">FluidSynth Documentation:</extref>
						<kbd>The loaded SoundFonts are treated as a stack, where each new loaded SoundFont is
						placed at the top of the stack. When selecting presets by bank and program numbers,
						SoundFonts are searched beginning at the top of the stack. In the case where there are
						presets in different SoundFonts with identical bank and program numbers, the preset from
						the most recently loaded SoundFont is used.</kbd><br/>
						As a lightweight alternative to FluidSynth, <Exult/> can be compiled against 
						<extref target="https://github.com/divideconcept/FluidLite">FluidLite</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>MT32Emu</strong><br/>
						Roland MT32 emulation requires either the ROM set 'MT32_CONTROL.ROM' and 'MT32_PCM.ROM' or
						the ROM set 'CM32L_CONTROL.ROM' and 'CM32L_PCM.ROM' in the <Exult/> data folder.
						If both sets are present the CM32L ROM-set will be used.<br/>
						On case sensitive Operating Systems these files have to be saved in uppercase.<br/>
						For the <extref target="https://flathub.org/apps/info.exult.exult">Flatpak package</extref>
						on Linux, these should be stored in <kbd>$HOME/.var/app/info.exult.exult/data/mt32emu/</kbd>.</li>
					<li><strong>Windows</strong><br/>

					<li><strong>CoreAudio</strong><br/>
						uses XMIDI on macOS and iOS. You can use a different SoundFont than macOS' default by copying a 
						Soundfont file into the data and select it in the <ref1 target="advanced_midi_gump"/>.<br/>
						On iOS there is no default SoundFont thus you have to provide one yourself.</li>
					<li><strong>CoreMIDI</strong><br/>
						on macOS this MIDI driver allows using a real MIDI device like a Roland MT32 or software
						MIDI devices like Munt MT-32 Emulator. If you have more than one MIDI device you can choose the
						the device in the <ref1 target="advanced_midi_gump"/>.<br/>
						On iOS you can use a real device through an USB-to-MIDI adapter that is connected to the
						Lightning or USB-C port of the iOS device.</li>
					<li><strong>Alsa</strong><br/>
						uses ALSA on Linux systems. If your ALSA port is not on 65:0 you need to change
						&lt;config&gt;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;midi&gt;&lt;alsa_port&gt; in the exult.cfg.</li>
					<li><strong>UnixSeqDevice</strong><br/>
						Linux systems write to special symbolic file, default '/dev/sequencer'. This can be
						changed at &lt;config&gt;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;midi&gt;&lt;unixseqdevice&gt; in the exult.cfg.<br/>
						Because of size constraints we abbreviated it to <strong>UnixSeq</strong> in the

					For drivers that use a real or system MIDI device, the MIDI conversion can be changed to:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Real MT32</strong><br/>
						This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because
						the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if
						you have a MT32 compatible device. With this option <Exult/> will
						also send SysEx messages to the Roland MT32 display, which are nice
						to watch when you have such a device.</li>
					<li><strong>GM</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General MIDI patches.
						Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.</li>
					<li><strong>GS</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This
						will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the
						MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all MIDI devices will
						support this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>GS127</strong><br/>
						This option is for MIDI devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed
						in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use
						this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.</li>
					<li><strong>Fake MT32</strong><br/>
						This is for MIDI devices that behave like a MT32 but don't support
						SysEx messages. Use that option if you have a SoundFont or similar loaded
						for your sound card (or software synth such as FluidSynth) that contains
						the MT32 capital tones but the device can't be reprogrammed using MT32
						SysEx commands by <Exult/>.</li>

					OGG format. Simon Quinn recorded the current Digital Music pack on an original
					Roland MT-32 and with this you will experience the music as it would be heard with
					the original game.<br/>
					Digital Music should work on any platform that supports digital sound and does not
					use any MIDI, so it is also a good option for platforms with no MIDI support.
					Additionally, Digital Music supports a number of background atmospheric SFX tracks
					that are played when no music is playing. These consist of wind, bird etc effects
					outside and other sound effects when inside a dungeon. These SFX tracks are not
					available when using MIDI as they play Roland MT-32 specific voices that cannot

					increasing  the quality of the graphics and maintaining the same viewing
					area. This allows <Exult/> to show the game as an enhanced version of how it
					originally appeared, and not show locations that were originally off-screen.<br/>
					When you first start <Exult/> we apply the scaler 2xSaI which doubles the size
					of each pixel, resulting in a 640x400 window.

				<para>
					You will also have to hit 'Apply' in the Video gump to apply your changes. <Exult/>
					will then use the new settings and will show you a countdown which asks you to confirm
					that the new video settings are working. When you don't confirm by hitting 'YES', the
					changes will be reverted. This way we try to prevent that some bad video options
					combinations prevent you from playing the games.

					The game area with scaler applied should not be bigger than the display,
					otherwise you will get strange effects and the game might crash.<br/>
					For example when you set the game area to 320x200 with the scaler Point
					at sale factor 3, your game viewing area is actually 960x600. If your display
					resolution is set to 640x480 the resolutions don't match and your <Exult/>
					window will be smaller than intended.<br/>
					<Exult/> will check whether this will happen and will warn you against it, since
					making the window smaller than 320x200 will cause you trouble with <Exult/>s
					interface and you might not be able to revert your changes.<br/>
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand when your display resolution is set higher than the game resolution
					you can have black borders surrounding the game viewing area. The borders can be used
					for positioning gumps and the face stats.<br/>
					You can also change the color of the borders.<br/>
					If you don't like black borders you can also stretched to fill the entire display
					resolution, or sacled to fit the display resolution without stretching the pixels.<br/>
					You have the following options
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Fill</strong><br/>
						The game screen is stretched to fill the entire display surface. No borders will be added
						in this mode. The game screen will be downsampled if it is bigger than the display
						surface in this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>Fit</strong><br/>
						Game is scaled to fill the display surface maintaining square pixels. Black borders
						will be added to maintain aspect if needed. The game screen will be downsampled if it
						is bigger than the display surface in this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>Aspect Correct Fit</strong><br/>
						Same as fit, but pixels are additionally scaled using a 1:1.2 ratio. This corrects the
						aspect mismatch between the non square pixels used by the original game and the square
						pixels of modern screen resolutions.</li>
					<li><strong>Centre</strong><br/>
						The game is centered on the display surface without additional scaling. Black borders will
						be added if game screen is smaller than the display surface. Clipping will occur if the
						game screen is larger than the display surface.</li>
					<li><strong>Aspect Correct Centre</strong><br/>
						Same as Centre except height is scaled by 1.2x to correct pixel aspect mismatch.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					If the Game Area setting is set to Auto then the game area is calculated based on the selected
					fill mode with no additional scaling applied.<br/>
					The additional scaling method can be set to Point or Bilinear.

					Especially on mobile devices it makes sense to have a shortcutbar that allows quick actions
					with just one or a double click. This was first implemented in the
					<extref target="https://github.com/litchie/exult-ios">Exult for iOS</extref> fork but later
					back ported and improved in main <Exult/>. By default the shortcutbar is disabled, but can be
					enabled and further configured in the <ref1 target="misc_gump"/>.<br/>
					You can make the bar transparent (only when drawn on the map) and select different colors
					for the outlines around the buttons. Some buttons only work when you have a certain item
					(spellbook, jawbone in SI). You can choose to hide those buttons or display them greyed out.

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Floppy Disk</strong><br/>
					Single click opens the game menu, double click the <ref1 target="savemenu"/><br/>
					Additionally clicking it will close all Gumps that are open.</li>
					<li><strong>Dove/Flaming Sword</strong><br/>
					Toggles combat but also shows you whether you are in combat mode (flaming sword) when combat
					is toggled in another way.</li>
					<li><strong>Map</strong><br/>
					Shows you the map, on double click opens the map teleporter</li>
					<li><strong>Spellbook</strong><br/>
					Opens your spellbook if you have it.</li>
					<li><strong>Backpack</strong><br/>
					On each click opens the paperdoll of party members.</li>
					<li><strong>Key (Keyring in SI)</strong><br/>
					Single click gives you a target pointer that tries all keys on the lock you click on. A double
					click uses a lockpick if you have any in your party.<br/>
					When you acquire the keyring in SI, the button will change into the keyring and use that on a
					single click.</li>
					<li><strong>Notebook</strong><br/>
					Opens the notebook (see <ref1 target="notebook"/>), on double click shows you the
					cheat menu.</li>
					<li><strong>Target</strong><br/>
					single click gives you the target pointer, double click changes the pointer to a red cross
					which will cheat teleport you wherever you click.</li>
					<li><strong>Fork and Knife</strong><br/>
					A single click lets you feed a party member while a double click will use bandages or healing
					potions to heal.</li>

					Since 2020 the port is merged in our code.

			<body>
				<para>
					Once you have the <Exult/> app on your device, you will need to upload the games to your
					device using Finder or iTunes file sharing. But it needs a bit of preparing.
				</para>
				<para>
					First you will need to put the games into a folder called game and use the following
					folder structure:<br/>
					<kbd>game</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>+-- blackgate</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|     +--- static</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|          +---- *.*</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>+-- serpentisle</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|     +--- static</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|          +---- *.*</kbd><br/>
					Please make sure that all the file and folder names are in lowercase, iOS is case sensitive
					and the games might not be detected otherwise.<br/>
					Don't write <kbd>+--</kbd> - it's only there to visualize the structure. With <kbd>*.*</kbd>
					all the files of the static folder are meant.
				</para>
				<para>
					On Windows connect your device to your computer, start iTunes and select your device in it. Click 'Apps',
					scroll down to 'File Sharing' and select <Exult/>. Now drag and drop the game folder you prepared
					in the first step. See
					<extref target="https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/transfer-files-itns32636/windows">
					Apple's guide</extref>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On macOS you have to use Finder, select your iOS device, click on 'Files' and select
					<Exult/>. Now drag and drop the game folder you prepared in the first step. See
					<extref target="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/sync-files-to-your-device-mchl4bd77d3a/mac">
					Apple's guide</extref>.<br/>
					On older macOS versions you have to use iTunes as you would on Windows.
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>Only</strong> use Finder or iTunes file sharing and not the Files app on iOS as you are likely
					to end up with an incomplete game. The many small files of the games massiively slow down the Files app
					and as soon as you switch to another app, the transfer is likely to stop.
				</para>
				<para>
					Note: if you want to use mods just add them to the game folder structure before you drag and drop
					that in iTunes file sharing.<br/>
					Example with the BG keyring and SI fixes mods:<br/>
					<kbd>game</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>+-- blackgate</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|     +--- static</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>|          +---- *.*</kbd><br/>

					Alternately, if you have purchased the game from another site or own a hard copy on CD (or the original floppy

					The way <Exult/> generates default paths (for gamedat, savegames, mods, patches) has changed since Version 1.2. It will
					not write these paths to exult.cfg but use them automatically.<br/>
					The location where <Exult/> expects those, and if needed, will create those folders is similarly depending on the Operating
					System as the location of exult.cfg (see <ref1 target="exult_config_location"/>).
					If you were to override these paths you would need to change the following tags (you can substitute gamename with the
					'known games' - see <ref target="terms"/>):

					But normally you don't need to. On starting up, <Exult/> will first read which games
					are available as configured in exult.cfg.
					Then it will use the &lt;path&gt; setting and assume that &lt;static_path&gt; is &lt;path&gt;/static.<br/>
					For &lt;savegame_path&gt;, &lt;gamedat_path&gt;, &lt;mods&gt; and &lt;patch&gt; <Exult/> will assume
					Operating System specific paths.
				</para>
				<para>
					These folders are used for:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;data_path&gt;<br/>
						the most important folder. In this folder are the files <Exult/> absolutely needs to run. We also check the checksums of these
						files to make sure that <Exult/> uses the correct ones.</li>
					<li>&lt;static_path&gt;<br/>
						the second most important folder. In there you have the data files from the original game. You should
						never touch these files.</li>
					<li>&lt;savegame_path&gt;<br/>
						this is where <Exult/> stores your savegames.</li>
					<li>&lt;gamedat_path&gt;<br/>
						contains the (dynamic) data for the game you're currently playing. It's where the
						'journey onward' and 'quicksave' 'savegame' is stored.</li>
					<li>&lt;mods&gt;<br/>
						here mods for games are saved to. More information on this at <ref1 target="mods_intro"/></li>
					<li>&lt;patch&gt;<br/>
						Patches for games are saved here. More information on this at <ref1 target="mods_intro"/></li>

					Some notes for <strong>all</strong> Operating Systems:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>On Windows all of these settings, except for the &lt;path&gt; setting, are
						<strong>optional and not required</strong>,
						Exult will sort this out on its own.</li>
					<li>On Linux and macOS you might even not need to touch the &lt;path&gt; setting, if you stick to
						our standard gamenames.</li>
					<li>You can either use the relative (e.g. <kbd>./ultima7</kbd>) or absolute
						(e.g. <kbd>C:\Games\ultima7</kbd>) path to point to the correct folder. The relative path uses
						the exult.exe, exult binary or Exult.app as base.</li>
					<li>Better don't use spaces in the path (e.g. <kbd>C:\Games\the black gate\</kbd>). Some people
						seem to have reported problems with that.</li>
					<li>Path settings in exult.cfg are the <strong>same</strong> on <strong>all</strong> operating systems.
						Of course you need to make adjustments on Linux systems when you enter the absolute path.</li>
					<li><Exult/> and <Studio/> don't trust the exult.cfg 100% and will recognize which games
						you entered the path for. This means, that if you entered the path to SI in the
						&lt;blackgate&gt;&lt;path&gt; <Exult/> and <Studio/> will not be fooled.</li>
					<li>Don't ever point &lt;static_path&gt; and &lt;gamedat_path&gt; to the same folder.</li>

					Also not that you can quickly access this folder by executing <kbd>shell:Local AppData\Exult</kbd>
					in the 'Quick Access' of Explorer.<br/>
					For now <Exult/>'s data folder is always installed into the same folder where you installed
					<Exult/> to (default is <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\Exult</kbd>).<br/>
					Also note that in contrast to macOS and Linux systems there is no default path, where <Exult/> looks
					for the games. You have to choose that folder yourself, but the installer will ask you for the BG and SI
					folder to set your paths up.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example: User named <strong>FooBar</strong> on <strong>Windows 11</strong>. BG is installed
					to <kbd>C:\Ultima7\blackgate</kbd> and SI is installed to <kbd>C:\Ultima7\serpentisle</kbd>.
					The installer of <Exult/> asks for the location of these two games and automatically saves that to
					exult.cfg. The installer saves exult.cfg to <kbd>C:\Users\FooBar\AppData\Local\Exult\exult.cfg</kbd>.
					<Exult/> gets installed to <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\Exult</kbd>.<br/>
					When you save a game in BG the savegame will be saved to
					<kbd>C:\Users\FooBar\AppData\Local\Exult\blackgate\</kbd>, for SI to
					<kbd>C:\Users\FooBar\AppData\Local\Exult\serpentisle\</kbd>.<br/>
					If you install for example the keyring mod, you copy the contents of the Keyring.zip to
					<kbd>C:\Ultima7\blackgate\mods</kbd>. When you save a game with the Keyring mod, this savegame will be found in
					<kbd>C:\Users\FooBar\AppData\Local\Exult\blackgate\mods\keyring\</kbd>.

				<para>
					Since November 2011 you can buy Ultima VII from <extref target="https://www.gog.com">GOG</extref>.
					Unfortunately GOG only offers a Windows installer that you can't easily circumvent, which makes
					it a challenge for users that use a different OS than Windows.
				</para>
				<para>
					Right now the only way to get at the game files is to run the installer on Windows (or in WINE
					if you are not a Windows user). After the installation you will find the game files in
					<kbd>C:\GOG Games\Ultima 7</kbd> and
					<kbd>C:\GOG Games\Ultima 7 - Serpent Isle</kbd>.
				</para>
				<para>
					After installation you can just run our installer and when asked where the games are installed
					enter or browse to the above paths.<br/>
					Unfortunately GOG changes the download of the games for some unknown reason again and again. So our instructions are
					sometimes out of date. These ones are for the latest GOG release at the time of writing (version 1.0_(22309)). If it
					doesn't work, please let us know.
				</para>
				<para>
					On Linux systems you can use <extref target="https://constexpr.org/innoextract/">innoextract</extref> to extract the
					games from the GOG installer.<br/>

				<para>
					Since January 2013 <extref target="https://www.gog.com">GOG</extref> also offers a macOS download for each of the
					Ultima VII parts. These are install packages for macOS that will install the
					two parts into your Applications folder as applications that use a modified version of DOSBox to play the game.
					If you want to make <Exult/> automatically find the games, you will need to copy the game files from these
					applications to a different folder on your hard drive. To do this follow the next few steps.<br/>
					These instructions are the same whether you used the manual download from GOG or GOG Galaxy to install the games.
				</para>
				<para>
					Open Terminal.app found in the Utilities subfolder of your Applications folder and enter the following commands:<br/>
					<kbd>sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/Exult/blackgate"</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Application Support/Exult/serpentisle"</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>sudo cp -p -R "/Applications/Ultima VII<TM/>  - The Black Gate + The Forge of Virtue.app/Contents/Resources/game/STATIC" "/Library/Application Support/Exult/blackgate"</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>sudo cp -p -R "/Applications/Ultima VII<TM/>  - Serpent Isle + The Silver Seed.app/Contents/Resources/game/STATIC" "/Library/Application Support/Exult/serpentisle"</kbd><br/>
					Because we need elevated rights the commands are using sudo and will ask for your password and you
					will need to do this with an administrator account. If you don't have that, please ask your administrator
					to do this for you.<br/>
					Unfortunately GOG changes the download of the games for some unknown reason again and again. So our instructions are
					sometimes out of date. These ones are for the latest GOG release at the time of writing (gog_3_34095). If it doesn't work,
					please visit our forum and tell us.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you are on a Linux system you can extract the files from the install packages via xar. In the extracted folder

			<header>Installing the CD-ROM versions of Ultima VII</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					There are a couple of CD-ROM versions of Ultima VII. Most of these come with the add-ons pre-installed
					so with these you don't have to bother with installing the floppy disk version of the add-ons.
					To our knowledge the following CD-ROM versions exist:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>EA Compilation</strong><br/>
					This includes BG and a couple of other games (Savage Empire, Ultima Underworld and other non-Ultima games).
					Unfortunately BG does not have the add-on FoV included. From the CD just copy the folder <kbd>Ultima7</kbd> to
					<kbd>C:\Games\ULTIMA7</kbd>.</li>
					<li><strong>Ultima Collection</strong><br/>
					From the CD just copy the folders <kbd>Serpent</kbd> and <kbd>Ultima7</kbd> to <kbd>C:\Games\ULTIMA7</kbd>
					and <kbd>C:\Games\SERPENT</kbd>. Don't bother with the Ultima Collection installer. Both games come with
					the add-ons included.</li>
					<li><strong>The Complete Ultima VII (EA presents CD-ROM Classics)</strong><br/>
					On this CD-ROM the games are zipped in Serpent.zip and Ultima7.zip. Unzip serpent.zip to
					<kbd>C:\Games\SERPENT</kbd> and unzip Ultima7.zip to <kbd>C:\Games\ULTIMA7</kbd>.<br/>
					Both games come with the add-ons included.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					On Linux systems and macOS, you might run into a permissions problem. You need to set group
					permissions to read and write.<br/>
					On macOS select both game folders in Finder, bring up info, go to Ownership and Permissions,
					expand details, change Access under Group from read only to read and write, then
					click Apply.

			<header>Installing the floppy disks of BG/SI using DOSBox</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<extref target="https://dosbox.com">DOSBox</extref> is a program that emulates the old Dos
					and should run on any operating system that <Exult/> runs on (and more). So this is perfect
					for users that don't run Windows.
				</para>
				<para>
					To install Ultima VII with DOSBox, download and install DOSBox from
					<extref target="https://dosbox.com"/>. Make a new folder in your <kbd>C:\</kbd> drive
					called <kbd>Games</kbd>.<br/>
					Insert Disk 1 in your floppy drive, start DOSBox and enter the following:<br/>
					<kbd>mount c C:\Games</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>mount a a:\ -t floppy</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>a:</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>install</kbd><br/>
				</para>
				<para>
					These days you are less likely to have floppy drive in your computer. But if you created images
					of your game floppies you can use these to install the games.<br/>
					Follow the above instructions until you are asked to insert Disk 1. Instead enter these commands:<br/>
					<kbd>mount c C:\Games</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>imgmount a /path/bg-1.img /path/bg-2.img /path/bg-3.img /path/bg-4.img /path/bg-5.img /path/bg-6.img -t floppy</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>a:</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>install</kbd><br/>
					Replace path with the path to your image files. In case of installing Serpent Isle enter this
					for the imgmount command:<br/>
					<kbd>imgmount a /path/si-1.img /path/si-2.img /path/si-3.img /path/si-4.img /path/si-5.img /path/si-6.img /path/si-7.img -t floppy</kbd>
					When you are asked to change disk use the keyboard shortcut <key>Ctrl+F4</key>, which will use the next image.
				</para>
				<para>
					The installer will start and ask you on which drive to install Ultima VII to. Choose c and
					when it asks for the target folder choose <kbd>C:\ULTIMA7</kbd> for BG or
					<kbd>C:\SERPENT</kbd> for SI (in both cases you can just hit enter). Next you choose
					the sound card, but as this is not relevant for <Exult/>, choose 'No sound card'. Confirm the
					settings with 'Y' and the installer begins to make noise in your floppy drive...<br/>
					When asked to insert the next floppy disk and hit any key (or ESC to cancel). When the
					installation is done, the installer will complain, that 'something has put your system
					in protected mode...', ignore that and press any key to continue. Again it will complain
					that 'your current system configuration is not compatible with Ultima VII!...', ignore
					that as well and press 'N' (you don't need a boot disk for playing U7 with <Exult/>). Finally
					hit any key to finish your installation. Close DOSBox. The game can now be found at

				<para>
					Now you have to choose the drive where you installed the game to. Choose C and the installer

					When installing Ultima VII from floppy disks in Windows you can run into some problems.<br/>
					The installer assumes that all drives in the computer are hard drives and can't cope with
					drives like CD-ROMs and card readers. It tries to read how much free space the drives have
					and if there is no media in the drive it gives an error and you can't proceed.<br/>
					To solve this you have to insert a CD-ROM in your CD/DVD-ROM drive. If you have a multi card
					reader disconnect that if possible (or insert cards in all the slots if you have them). If
					disconnecting the reader is not possible you have to use one of the other ways to install the
					floppy versions or use a different computer.

				<para>
					Unfortunately it is possible that one of the floppies is no longer working. In that case the
					installation will fail and the installer might suggest that there is a device error and asks
