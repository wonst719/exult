				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.

				<cite name="Ibrahim Holtzmann">
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that

					However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any

		<sub name="exult_donation">
			<header>Do you accept donations?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No, the <Exult/> team will not accept donations. For us there are greater legal matters
					involved, which none of us particularly want to explore. We do not want to risk the
					wrath of EA for directly profiting off <Exult/>.<br/>

		<sub name="origin_exult">
			<header>Does Origin or EA support <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					First of all, Origin has been wiped from existence by EA a long time ago.
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin have claimed that
					the source code for Ultima VII (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <Exult/> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin years ago but received
					neither positive or negative response on the <Exult/> project. So far it seems
					that EA has decided to ignore <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated
					on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest
					(Programming Manager of Ultima VII)(hint:spell his name backwards).

		<sub name="other_ultimas">
			<header>Will <Exult/> support other Ultima games?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> supports only Ultima VII (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima VII in the
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering
					a game already.
				</para>

		<sub name="pentagram">
			<header>But isn't <Pentagram/> some kind of <Exult/> for U8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Pentagram/> is a pet project by some members of the <Exult/> team (currently mostly
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong>
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <Exult/>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br/>
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</para>
				<para>
					After years this plan has come to fruit and <Pentagram/> has been merged into
					<strong>ScummVM</strong>. Even support for the two games <strong>Crusader: No Remorse</strong>
					and <strong>Crusader: No Regret</strong>, which use the same engine, has been progressing
					in <strong>ScummVM</strong>'s code.

				<para>
					No.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff on the Forum">
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <Exult/>, in large part, because
					nobody makes games like Ultima VII anymore. While I think a multiplayer game
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <em>lots</em>
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.

					Note however that <Exult/> is open source. If you want a multiplayer Ultima VII no one

					Bugs and not yet implemented features in <Exult/> get fixed almost daily in the code.

				<para>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated every
					night if commits landed in our repository on that day. There is information on how to
					build your own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows
					and macOS executables.<br/>

			<header>On what platform does <Exult/> run?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on
					any platform that SDL2 supports. Right now the source can be compiled
					in <strong>Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,</strong> and
					<strong>Windows (XP/Vista/7, 10, 11)</strong>.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>iOS (iPhone and iPad)</strong><br/>
					After initial porting by our member Lanica Dragon, Chaoji Li (aka Litchie)
					successfully ported <Exult/> to iOS. On the iPad <Exult/>  really shines
					and is very enjoyable. However Ultima VII's item management makes it much
					harder to use on the smaller iPhone screens.<br/></li>

					<li><strong>Android, Java</strong><br/>
					Jeff, Dr.Code, is started porting <Exult/> to Android by rewriting it in Java.
					Unfortunately this port has been abandoned but its former progress can be viewed in its
					old	<extref target="https://goo.gl/VJCNG">forum</extref> thread.</li>

					<li><strong>Android, native</strong><br/>
					KenC ported <Exult/> directly to Android, without rewriting it in Java. After a long
					hiatus he continued his work on
					<extref target="https://github.com/ceckak/exult/tree/android-port">Github</extref>,

				<para>
					<Exult/> used to run on many more platforms but these are mostly devices and operating systems that have
					not been in use for ages now. Support for these has been removed from the Exult source to streamline
					our code. Or the 3rd party ports have been inactive for years.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Windows 9X, 2k, XP</strong><br/>
					Since we needed to go forward with our code we decided to no longer support the old Windows versions.</li>
					<li><strong>Zaurus</strong><br/>
					Artaxerxes developed the port to Zaurus, a Linux/ARM based PDA.
					It is already fully playable (Artaxerxes played through SI). Pictures of the Zaurus
					running SI can be found at

					<li><strong>PocketPC</strong><br/>
					Lanica Dragon successfully ported <Exult/> to the PocketPC.</li>
					<li><strong>Amiga/MorphOS</strong><br/>
					Ruediger Hanke ported <Exult/> to MorphOS and AmigaOS. Unfortunately the port has
					been abandoned for quite some time now. But you can only find the archived homepage
					for this port at
					<extref target="https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190600/http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html"/>.

		<sub name="any_port">
			<header>Will there be a port of <Exult/> for &lt;insert platform here&gt;?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					That depends on a great many things. For one, it requires a developer that (1) has the
					necessary free time, (2) the necessary knowledge about programming for the platform in
					question, (3) the necessary motivation to do the port and (4) access to the platform in
					question. Any of the <Exult/> developers may lack one or more of the items above, but it
					will probably the fourth (and, by consequence, the third) item. This is likely fatal
					for the port: programming using an emulator (if one is even available) may result in a
					port that works on the emulator but not on the original (unless the emulator is that
					good), and programming without any access at all to the platform in question is a
					pointless and frustrating exercise in futility.
				</para>
				<para>
					Moreover, some platforms might require BG and/or SI to come bundled with <Exult/>; that alone
					would disqualify any official builds for legal reasons.

					In the past there were reported problems with the localized versions of the

					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all

					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since <Exult/> is open-source,

			<header>Why is the party formation different?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In <Exult/> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than
					they do in the original. The problem is that this was controlled by the original
					executable. Changing the formation now is not as easy as it sounds as the party
					formation has effects on other game internals. Changing it to be more like the
					original may force us to replay the whole game to make sure we didn't introduce
					new bugs.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some time ago Jeff added an optional formation that behaves way more like in the
					original game and it has become the default formation now.<br/>
					This can be changed in the <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config">exult.cfg</extref>.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to

		<sub name="save_crash">
			<header>What should I do when Exult keeps crashing when I try to save?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					This is <strong>not</strong> normal behavior for <Exult/>. Normally when you restart
					and "Journey Onward" <Exult/> will actually restore to the point you saved.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Please do not play further</em> at this point. You should restore to an earlier
					save game, no matter how much game time you loose. Your game must have gotten
					corrupted and when you play on with it you will most likely experience even more
					serious problems.
				</para>
				<para>
					Please also avoid saving when a scripted sequence is running. Whenever you can't control
					the Avatar on your own a scripted scene is running and saving at this time may break the

		<sub name="choppy_game">
			<header>Why does the game run so choppy?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Well, every Ultima required a fast computer. Even though <Exult/> is just an
					engine that runs the ancient Ultima VII it still requires a fast computer.
				</para>
				<para>
					Seriously, if the game runs choppy for you, try the speed setting in the Game Options
					menu and if that doesn't help also play with the original resolution (320x200),

		<sub name="blank_screen">
			<header>Why does my monitor stay black when I try to run <Exult/>?</header>

					The most common reason for this is that you try to run <Exult/> full screen in a
					resolution that isn't supported by either your monitor or your graphics card.
					Edit your exult.cfg (see <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config"/>) to disable
					full screen. If <Exult/> now runs fine in a window you have to select a different
					resolution (also editable in exult.cfg) to run it full screen.<br/>

					<extref target="docs.html">Documentation</extref> and many of the following
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open
					this Game Options Menu by pressing <key>Esc</key> in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the
					Gameplay Options.<br/>
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new save game box. This allows you much more save games than
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of save game
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game
					box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Double-clicking on the face opens
					the inventory and double-clicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheel mouse support. If you have a wheel mouse some features are auto-enabled
					in <Exult/>.<br/>
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right.
					Holding down <key>Alt</key> while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br/>
					The save game menu scrolls one line, while pressing <key>Alt</key> it scrolls
					pages.<br/>
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing
					<key>Alt</key>  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in full screen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed save games. <Exult/> compresses save games by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the save game name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				<li>A notebook for making notes and the possibility to automatically add notes.</li>
				<li>Shortcut bar on top of the screen with many useful shortcuts. This is especially
					useful for touch devices without a physical keyboard (.e.g. iOS devices).</li>
				<li>The Serpent Isle extended intro. This was slimmed down in the original to save
					floppy disk space but we restored it from material posted online by the artist
					Denis Loubet.</li>

				Are there issues with the SI style paperdoll in BG?

			<body>
				<para>
					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.<br/>
					That means:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. For this to change we'd
					need a volunteer to recreate a lot of paperdoll art for a smaller paperdoll.

					To get an Ultima VII that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there

						in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and
						Serpents Isle.<br/>
						To enable the old save game menu you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
						(the line in your custom key bindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)</li>
					<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
					<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
					<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Display
						options.</li>
					<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and
						disable scalers.</li>

						be altered. Sorry!</li>

			<body>
				<ol>
					<li>Read the <extref target="https://exult.info/docs.html">Documentation</extref>
						and this FAQ to see if that is not already covered and you have all set up correctly.</li>
					<li>Before you report a bug to the
						<extref target="https://github.com/exult/exult/issues">bug tracker</extref>
						please try the latest
						<extref target="https://exult.info/download.html">snapshot</extref>.
						If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else has already reported the bug
						(in the bug tracker).</li>
					<li>You can only submit a bug report in our tracker if you are a
						<extref target="https://github.com">GitHub</extref> member.</li>
					<li>Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae
						don't just write "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more
						sense.</li>
					<li>Include information on what version of <Exult/> you are using. You should have used
						the latest snapshot but please tell us the date of the snapshot.</li>
					<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 11, Ubuntu, macOS 14.4,...).</li>
					<li>Please include a save game (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find
						those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav
						(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename in the
						save game dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game
						may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to
						report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit
						as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).</li>
					<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Exult/>. These are named stdout.txt and
						stderr.txt and can be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see
						<ref1 target="where_cfg"/>.</li>
					<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Studio/>. These are named studio_out.txt and
						studio_err.txt and can also be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see

			<header>Broken by Design</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima VII. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original
					worked.<br/>
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount
					of time and effort to fix.<br/>
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done
					differently sits down and codes it.<br/>
					The following are such 'features' of <Exult/>:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient
						creatures of Britannia do. You should rarely encounter this anymore
						since there are better intelligence checks, but it can still happen.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this was disputed almost every four weeks.
						Finally it works like the original and the Avatar uses two frames and the
						companions use three frames.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <Exult/>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by Ultima VII's original data
						files but the original didn't. Users who prefer the original (broken) are able
						to choose so in the Game menu.</li>
					<li>Some sound effects (sfx) are missing. While we still haven't implemented some sfx,
						most are playing and we have improved upon the original by allowing more sound
						effects to play at the same time and also balance the effect when it is a continuous
						one, meaning its volume is affected how near you are the sfx playing object and also
						differs between left and right. However we found the fire effects to be terrible in
						quality and have disabled these. So no crackling fire for the flaming sword,
						campfires, etc.</li>

				<para>
					Although you can find many useful gameplay FAQs on the internet we do get asked
					some questions quite frequently as people think these are bugs with <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					Most of the times the problem is that people don't play the game regularly but depend
					overly on walkthroughs and don't read what NPCs in the game tell you to do.
				</para>

					<strong>Note that this section contains text that may spoil your game.
					Caution is advised.</strong>

		<sub name="who_speaks">
			<header>Why don't all NPCs have audible speech (BG+SI)?</header>

					The documentation and installation files of the original may be a bit misleading.
					There are only a few NPCs in the games that have audible speech. In BG only the
					Guardian can be heard during the game.<br/>
					Apart from the Intro you can only hear the Guardian and the Great Earth Serpent
					in SI.

		<sub name="reagents_differ">
			<header>Why do spells require different reagents than the manual lists (BG+SI)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The manuals of both BG and SI listed different requirements for two spells than what
					was actually required in the original game and <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>BG Restoration<br/>
						The original game and <Exult/> use garlic, ginseng, mandrake root, spider silk.<br/>
						Manual lists garlic, ginseng, mandrake root, sulfurous ash.</li>
					<li>SI Imbalance<br/>
						The original game and <Exult/> use bloodspawn, nightshade, serpent scale, sulfurous ash,
						worm heart,<br/>
						while the Manual lists nightshade, serpent scale, sulfurous ash, worm heart.</li>

		<sub name="sextant_roof">
			<header>Why can't I see my location on the map (BG+SI)?</header>

					"I'm trying to get Forsythe in Skara Brae to sacrifice himself to destroy the well of
					souls. But I can't seem to get Rowenna or Trent to talk to me about sacrifice."<br/>
					The solution to this is that Rowenna and Trent are standing too far apart. When you
					reunited the pair you initiated the conversation with Trent from too far away
					(this happens when you run at a higher resolution than the original one).<br/>
					Now you can either reload a game from before you reunited them or you have to hackmove
					Rowenna closer to Trent. After that the two will talk to you about sacrifice.

					This was fixed in more recent versions of <Exult/> but with games started with earlier
					versions this bug is still present. You need to start a new game of <Exult/> to fix

			<header>Left or right on the Altar of Discipline (SI)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In the Temple of Discipline you need to place a quartz and obsidian symbol
					(Y-shape) onto the altar to disable the trap and to call a bridge into being.<br/>
					The book "The Symbol of Discipline" you find in the upper floor states:
				</para>
				<cite name="The Symbol of Discipline by Sharless">
					The altar before the serpent statue doth have upon it two slots ...
					bolts of lightning fire from the altar unless the quartz symbol is placed
					in the slot on the left side. A bridge ... is called into being if the obsidian
					symbol is placed in the right slot...
				</cite>
				<para>
					This is highly confusing as the player looks at the screen and associates west
					in the game with left and east with right. Whoever wrote this originally must
					have imagined the Avatar standing to the north of the altar and facing the temple
					entrance.<br/>
					So you need to place the quartz symbol onto the east depression of the altar and
					the obsidian symbol onto the west depression.

			<header>Why some NPCs are unable to open doors if their schedule requires it (SI-SS)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Cantra, Lydia, Frigidazzi, Frigidazzi's Messenger (Goblin Woman) and skinless Yelinda
					are unable to open/close doors. This is apparent when their schedules change and you
					try to observe them by following them around.
				</para>
				<para>
					The original and <Exult/> determine the ability to open doors by the intelligence
					assigned to the shape of an NPC and not the intelligence the NPCs have in the game.
