Notes:

Menu font:
The menu font is not replaced yet as it is used for quotes and credits and both official translations of BG to French and German use a different letters map for special characters. This needs to be solved differently before replacing the menu font with our own.

INTRO.DAT:
Font shape #14 is used in both the intro and the endgame and uses only three colors (index #252, #253, #254). The font uses the palette of the flic files it is overlayed on and these three colors are deliberately set for the font.
When you edit the shape in The Gimp, make sure the darker grey is set to color #253 before saving it as The Gimp likes to auto assign a different color (on all frames of the shape).

6_endgame_*.shp:
This font is used in both BG and SI for the congratulations screen and therefore has the @ readded to its UTF-8 position.

Adding new characters:
For those characters for which the position in our fonts files do not match their position in the UTF-8 encoding table we are using a map in files/msgfile.cc, remapping their positions to their positions in our fonts.
When you add new characters, orient yourself at 2_small_black.shp as that is the most complete font (others do not need all the special characters it provides). Make sure that you do not add a character to frame #32 as that is reserved for space.
Adding new characters after the last current frame is save to do, remember to add the new position to the map in files/msgfile.cc.

Adding new fonts shapes:
When you add new fonts don't forget to edit data/fonts/original.in, data/fonts/serif.in, data/Makefile.am, Makefile.common, msvcstuff/vs2019/data/data.vcxproj.
